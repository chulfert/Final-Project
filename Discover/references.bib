ABSTRACT={<p>The precise organization and arrangement of neural cells is essential for nervous system functionality. Cellular tiling is an evolutionarily conserved phenomenon that organizes neural cells, ensuring non-redundant coverage of receptive fields in the nervous system. First recorded in the drawings of Ramon y Cajal more than a century ago, we now have extensive knowledge of the biochemical and molecular mechanisms that mediate tiling of neurons. The advent of live imaging techniques in both invertebrate and vertebrate model organisms has enhanced our understanding of these processes. Despite advancements in our understanding of neuronal tiling, we know relatively little about how glia, an essential non-neuronal component of the nervous system, tile and contribute to the overall spatial arrangement of the nervous system. Here, we discuss lessons learned from neurons and apply them to potential mechanisms that glial cells may use to tile, including cell diversity, contact-dependent repulsion, and chemical signaling. We also discuss open questions in the field of tiling and what new technologies need to be developed in order to better understand glial tiling.</p>}}

abstract = {Two experiments are reported in which Ss were required to determine whether a random, angular form, presented at any of a number of picture-plane orientations, was a “standard” or “reflected” version. Average time required to make this determination increased linearly with the angular departure of the form from a previously learned orientation. The slope and intercept of the reaction-time (RT) function were virtually constant, regardless of the perceptual complexity of the test form and the orientation selected for initial learning. When Ss were informed in advance as to the identity and the orientation of the upcoming test form and, further, were permitted to indicate when they were prepared for its external presentation, RT for determining the version of the form was constant for all test-form orientations. However, the time needed to prepare for the test-form presentation increased linearly with the angular departure of the form from the learned orientation. It is argued that the processes both of preparing for and of responding to a disoriented test form consist of the mental rotation of an image, and that both sorts of mental rotation (pre-stimulus and post-stimulus) are carried out at essentially the same constant rate.}

abstract = {Mental rotation may be considered a prototypical example of a higher-order transformational process that is nonsymbolic and analog as opposed to propositional. It is therefore a paradigm case for testing the view that these properties are fundamentally right-hemispheric. Evidence from brain-imaging, unilateral brain lesions, commissurotomy, and visual-hemifield differences in normals is reviewed. Although there is some support for a right-hemispheric bias, at least for the holistic rotation of relatively simple shapes, it is unlikely that this bias approaches the degree of left-hemispheric dominance for language-related skills. An evolutionary scenario is sketched in which the characteristically symbolic mode of the left hemisphere evolved relatively late and achieved the quality of recursive generativity only in the late stages of hominid evolution. This forced an increasingly right-hemispheric bias onto analog processes like mental rotation. Such processes nevertheless remain important and are integral even to those processes we think of as highly symbolic, such as language and mathematics.}
